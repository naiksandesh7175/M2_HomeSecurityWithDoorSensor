# M2_HomeSecurityWithDoorSensor
Design And Simulation of Circuits And Embedded Systems

Here is a Project developed as mini project in embedded c as Home Security With Door Sensor Door sensors are an essential component of your home security system In this mini project you can get status of our Home Door which is closed or open If the Led connected to atmega port is high means if Led is Flashing then you can get the idea about status of Door i.e our door is open similarly, If the Led connected to atmega controller port is low means Led is not Flashing then you can get that the Door is Closed this is all becoz of I have made a system that if Door is closed then there will be no supply to the Led so Led will not glow similarly for open of door there will be supply of 5V that i have made so that Led will glow there so this is how you can get status of your Home Door with this Embedded project
